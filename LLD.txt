Components Involved:
Client: The user or application making the login request.
Express Server: The server that handles incoming HTTP requests.
User Controller: Contains the login function to handle the login logic.
MongoDB: The database where user data is stored.
bcrypt: A library for hashing and comparing passwords.
jsonwebtoken (jwt): A library for generating JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
Flow:
Client sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with the email and password in the request body.
Express Server routes the request to the login function in the User Controller.
User Controller:
Extracts the email and password from the request body.
Queries MongoDB to find a user with the provided email.
If the user is not found, returns a 400 response with "Invalid credentials".
If the user is found, uses bcrypt to compare the provided password with the stored hashed password.
If the passwords do not match, returns a 400 response with "Invalid credentials".
If the passwords match, generates a JWT token using jsonwebtoken.
Removes the password field from the user object before sending the response.
Returns a 200 response with the user object (without the password) and the JWT token.
Client receives the response containing the user details and the token.
